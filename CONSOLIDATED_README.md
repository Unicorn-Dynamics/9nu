## Quick Start

### Cloning External Repositories

When network access to git.savannah.gnu.org is available:

```bash
./clone-repos.sh
```

This script will clone all the external repositories into the appropriate directory structure.

### Exploring the Architecture

1. **System Overview**: Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a comprehensive architectural analysis
2. **Component Details**: Explore individual component documentation in `external/*/README.md` files
3. **Development Planning**: Review [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATHWAYS.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATHWAYS.md) for contribution opportunities

## Key Documents

- **[Architecture Overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Complete system architecture with mermaid diagrams
- **[Development Pathways](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATHWAYS.md)**: Structured development opportunities and guidance
- **[Open Issues Documentation](docs/open-issues/README.md)**: Comprehensive documentation addressing GNU Hurd open issues
- **[External Repository Overview](external/README.md)**: Organization of external components

## Architecture Highlights

### Microkernel Design
The GNU Hurd follows a multiserver architecture built on the GNU Mach microkernel:

- **GNU Mach**: Provides core kernel services (IPC, virtual memory, scheduling)
- **Hurd Servers**: Implement system services as user-space servers
- **Translators**: Enable extensible file system and device abstractions
- **glibc**: Provides POSIX API and system call interface

### Component Interaction
- All components communicate via Mach IPC
- MIG generates interface code from formal specifications
- Translators provide flexible system extension mechanisms
- Threading support enables concurrent server operations

## Development Opportunities

### Beginner Level
- Documentation improvement
- Testing and bug fixes
- Simple translator development
- User experience enhancements

### Intermediate Level
- Core library enhancement
- System server development
- Device driver porting
- Performance optimization

### Advanced Level
- Microkernel development
- Next-generation kernel (Viengoos)
- MIG compiler enhancement
- Research and innovation

## Current Status

This repository represents a consolidation effort to:
1. Organize all Hurd ecosystem components in one place
2. Provide comprehensive architectural documentation
3. Guide new and experienced developers
4. Support research and development initiatives

The external repositories are organized with placeholder documentation. Use the `clone-repos.sh` script to populate them with actual source code when network access is available.

## Contributing

1. **Explore**: Review the architecture and component documentation
2. **Choose**: Select a development pathway that matches your interests and skills
3. **Start**: Begin with documentation or simple code contributions
4. **Engage**: Participate in the Hurd community discussions
5. **Grow**: Take on increasingly complex development challenges

## Resources

- **GNU Hurd Project**: https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/
- **Mailing Lists**: https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-hurd
- **IRC**: #hurd on libera.chat
- **Bug Tracking**: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=hurd
- **Manual Merge Guide**: [MANUAL_MERGE_GUIDE.md](MANUAL_MERGE_GUIDE.md) - For resolving branch conflicts via command line

## Next Steps

1. Run `./clone-repos.sh` when network access permits
2. Explore the component documentation in `external/*/README.md`
3. Review development pathways in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATHWAYS.md`
4. Choose a starting point based on your interests and experience level
5. Begin contributing to the GNU Hurd ecosystem!
