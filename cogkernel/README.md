# Cognitive Kernel for GNU Hurd

A self-evolving scaffolding that unifies OpenCog's hypergraph memory, Agent-Zero's agentic orchestration, ElizaOS's middleware, Plan9/Inferno's namespaces, and GUIX's declarative build system.

## Architecture

The cognitive kernel implements five core subsystems as tensor-shaped membranes within a recursive P-System:

### Subsystem Mapping
| Subsystem | Functionality | Tensor Shape |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Memory (AtomSpace) | Hypergraph of capabilities, issues, builds | [n_atoms x n_links x n_features x n_contexts] |
| Task (Agents) | Distributed agentic scripts (Agent-Zero/ElizaOS) | [n_agents x n_roles x n_actions x n_envs] |
| AI (Analytics) | Inference, pattern matching, learning (PLN/MOSES) | [n_nodes x n_rules x n_weights x n_iters] |
| Autonomy (Self-Mod) | Self-repair, audit, recursive code rewriting | [n_scripts x n_triggers x n_targets x n_versions] |
| Build (GUIX/Guile) | Declarative, reproducible builds | [n_pkgs x n_derivations x n_deps x n_states] |

## Cognitive Flow

1. Issue detected → Atom creation in hypergraph
2. Dynamic attention allocation (ECAN)
3. Agentic task orchestration (Scheme/Guile)
4. Reasoning/learning (PLN/MOSES → ggml tensor ops)
5. GUIX-powered build/repair
6. Hypergraph & meta-agentic audit

## Integration with GNU Hurd

The cognitive kernel integrates with the GNU Hurd ecosystem through:
- Scheme/Guile scripting for system orchestration
- Integration with existing Hurd servers and translators
- GUIX declarative build system
- IPC mechanisms for inter-component communication
