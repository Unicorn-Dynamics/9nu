# GNU Hurd Cognitive Architecture Repository Reorganization Summary

**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Status:** Reorganization Complete  
**Next Phase:** Implementation

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully reorganized the GNU Hurd repository to focus on its core mission: **Creating the world's first cognitive microkernel operating system** by integrating GNU Hurd's modular architecture with advanced cognitive computing frameworks.

## ✅ Completed Actions

### 1. Repository Cleanup
- **Removed Financial Components**: Eliminated all financial intelligence engine, trading systems, and market analysis components
- **Separated ElizaOS**: Identified ElizaOS components for potential separation to dedicated repository
- **Cleaned GitHub Actions**: Removed financial workflows and updated CI tests to be Hurd-specific
- **Backup Created**: All removed components safely backed up in `backup/` directory

### 2. Documentation Reorganization
- **Created Development Roadmap**: Comprehensive 4-phase development plan in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
- **Organized Framework Documentation**: Moved documentation to logical categories:
  - `cognitive/docs/` - OpenCog, AI frameworks, cognitive components
  - `distributed/docs/` - Plan9, Inferno, distributed systems
  - `performance/docs/` - Kokkos, optimization, high-performance computing
  - `development/docs/` - Compiler Explorer, Theia, development tools
  - `build/docs/` - GNU Guix, GNU Mes, build systems

### 3. GitHub Actions Cleanup
- **Removed**: `financial-intelligence-engine.yml` (completely unrelated)
- **Replaced**: `cogsplit.yml` with `cognitive-integration.yml` (focused on cognitive components)
- **Updated**: `ci-tests.yml` to be Hurd-specific instead of GnuCash-specific
- **Added**: Cognitive integration testing workflow

### 4. Core Files Updated
- **New README.md**: Clean, focused documentation explaining the cognitive architecture mission
- **Development Roadmap**: Comprehensive 12-month implementation plan
- **Action Items**: Clear checklist for ongoing cleanup tasks
