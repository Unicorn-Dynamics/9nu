Cognitive Flowchart for Transformative Issue-Based Testing Framework  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**I. Problem Identification:**  
  → Open issues exist as descriptive text; lacks actionable, testable form  
  → No structured mapping between development progress and issue resolution  
  → Solution ranking is subjective, not empirically measured by test outcomes  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**II. Subsystem Mapping (Adaptive Attention Allocation):**  
  A. Memory System  
    • Unit test corpus: Each issue encoded as a test describing failure mode, impact, and resolution criteria  
  B. Task System  
    • Issue-based test sets: Each feature or bugfix triggers entire suite, ranking solution efficacy  
  C. AI System  
    • Automated reasoning: Score commits by test coverage increase and regression reduction  
  D. Autonomy System  
    • Self-evolving prioritization: Weight unresolved/high-impact issues higher in next dev cycle  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**III. Pattern Recognition (Hypergraph Encoding):**  
  • Each issue → AtomSpace node  
  • Test dependencies → Hypergraph links  
  • Passing/failing tests → Activation levels in AtomSpace  
  • Interlinked tests allow propagation of solution impact across related issues  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**IV. Recursive Solution Design (Unit Test Synthesis):**  
  A. For each issue:  
    1. Extract core failure condition, reproduction steps, criteria for resolution  
    2. Generate unit/integration tests (in Scheme for cognitive representation)  
    3. Group tests into sets corresponding to issue categories (performance, stability, hardware, etc.)  
    4. Implement meta-tests for system-wide emergent behaviors (e.g., “all servers recover after crash”)  
  B. When adding a feature:  
    1. Run pre-change suite → record failures  
    2. Apply change  
    3. Run post-change suite → record improvements  
    4. Rank solution by:  
      • # issues resolved  
      • # new tests passed  
      • Regression-free delta  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**V. Meta-Cognitive Enhancement:**  
  • Schema for test generation extends to new issues automatically  
  • Cognitive synergy: System learns patterns in test failures, proposes optimizations  
  • Reflective reporting: “Which features most reduced issue set?”  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**VI. Implementation Pathways (Groundbreaking Beauty):**  
  1. Parse open-issues.md → extract issue objects  
  2. For each issue:  
    • Generate Scheme unit test skeleton  
    • Encode test dependencies as hypergraph links  
  3. Configure test runner to output coverage map as tensor (dimensions: test sets × issues × solution commits)  
  4. GGML customization: Each test result becomes a kernel in the cognitive grammar catalog, with shape based on degrees of freedom (inputs, outputs, dependencies)  
  5. Adaptive ranking algorithm:  
    • Attention allocation weights issues by impact, history, and dependency centrality  
    • Test runner schedules “most critical” tests first, optimizing development cycles  
  6. Reporting:  
    • Visualize solution impact as membrane-nested tensors (P-System metaphor)  
    • Track evolution of issue resolution in recursive strata  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**VII. Theatrical Finale (Maniacal Enthusiasm):**  
  → The system becomes a living tapestry of cognitive resilience; each bug slain is a neuron firing in the grand neural-symbolic dance!  
  → The test suite is not a list—it is a dynamic cortex, self-adapting, self-optimizing, and self-aware!  
  → Every feature added is greeted by a chorus of emergent patterns, validated, harmonized, and woven into the epic of distributed cognition!  
  → The flow of attention is orchestrated by recursive symphonies of activation, every solution a stanza in the verse of computational enlightenment!  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
**Next Steps:**  
  • Begin issue parsing and Scheme test generation for each open issue in docs/open-issues/open-issues.md  
  • Create GitHub issue: “Automated Issue-to-Test Mapping System” with actionable steps  
  • Scaffold cognitive test runner integrating GGML kernel shapes, hypergraph dependency encoding, and adaptive ranking  

Would you like a sample Scheme unit test template for one of the issues, or shall I scaffold the GitHub issue and implementation plan first?

Scaffold for Issue and Implementation Plan: Automated Issue-to-Test Mapping System

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── I. Problem Identification

The open issues listed in docs/open-issues/open-issues.md are not systematically mapped into a structured, actionable system of unit tests.
Lacking: A comprehensive catalog of test parameters derived from real-world issues to guide rigorous, empirical development and automated ranking of solutions.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── II. Subsystem Mapping

Memory System: Persistent catalog of issue-derived test parameters.
Task System: Orchestrates extraction, classification, and parameterization of issues into test sets.
AI System: Analyzes coverage, ranks solutions, and identifies emergent patterns in test results.
Autonomy System: Self-adapts catalog structure and test prioritization based on evolving issue landscape.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── III. Pattern Recognition

Hypergraph encoding: Each issue becomes a node; dependencies and impact form links.
Tensor parameterization: Each test parameter cataloged with tensor dimensions reflecting degrees of freedom (inputs, outputs, dependencies, resolution complexity).
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── IV. Recursive Solution Design

Parse docs/open-issues/open-issues.md:

Extract each issue, challenge, bug, and development area.
For each, identify: • Core problem statement • Impact domain (performance, stability, hardware, etc.) • Solution space (suggested fixes, mitigation strategies) • Test parameter candidates (inputs, expected outcomes, edge cases)
Generate test parameter catalog:

Structure as a markdown or JSON file (e.g., test-parameters-catalog.md or .json)
Each entry includes: • Issue ID or title • Test description • Parameter list (input domains, output domains, dependencies) • Complexity depth (tensor shape estimation) • Category tags
Implementation Plan:

Create the catalog file in docs/open-issues/test-parameters-catalog.md
Implement a script or action (Scheme preferred for cognitive representation, shell/C for glue) to auto-generate this catalog from the .md file.
Scaffold GitHub Actions integration for automatic updates when new issues are added or existing ones modified.
PR Structure:

docs/open-issues/test-parameters-catalog.md (catalog file)
scripts/generate-test-catalog.scm (Scheme script for extraction/encoding)
.github/workflows/update-test-catalog.yml (GitHub Action for automation)
README update with description of the testing framework and catalog purpose
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── V. Meta-Cognitive Enhancement

Self-updating catalog adapts to new issue complexity.
Catalog enables emergent ranking of solution efficacy, aligning development priorities with empirical test coverage.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── VI. Theatrical Finale

The repo becomes a living cognitive organism, its issue-based test catalog a neural tapestry evolving towards perfection!
Each commit, each feature, echoes through the membrane-nested tensor fields, harmonizing the cognitive grammar of distributed intelligence!
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Would you like me to proceed with creating a GitHub issue describing this implementation plan, or shall I scaffold the initial catalog file (e.g., test-parameters-catalog.md) and PR structure as the next step? Please specify your preference for the starting point (issue first, catalog file first, or both in parallel).
