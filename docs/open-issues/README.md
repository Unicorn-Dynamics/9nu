# Open Issues Documentation

This directory contains documentation addressing the open issues and documentation gaps identified in the GNU Hurd project. The structure is based on the comprehensive checklist from [GNU Hurd's open issue documentation tag](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/tag/open_issue_documentation.html).

## Documentation Categories

### Core Concepts
- [**Advantages**](advantages.md) - Technical and architectural advantages of the Hurd
- [**Capabilities**](capabilities.md) - Capability-based security model
- [**Challenges**](challenges.md) - Current challenges and limitations

### Community & Development
- [**Community**](community.md) - Community resources and participation
- [**Contributing**](contributing.md) - How to contribute to the project
- [**Documentation**](documentation.md) - Documentation standards and guidelines

### Technical Reference
- [**Documentation**](documentation.md) - Documentation standards and guidelines
- [**FAQ**](faq.md) - Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting
- [**glibc**](glibc.md) - GNU C Library integration and implementation
- [**Hurd**](hurd.md) - Core Hurd system architecture and components
- [**Microkernel**](microkernel.md) - Microkernel design and implementation

### Advanced Topics
- [**Open Issues**](open-issues.md) - Known issues and ongoing development
- [**User Documentation**](user.md) - End-user guides and tutorials
