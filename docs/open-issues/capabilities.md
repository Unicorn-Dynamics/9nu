# Capability-Based Security Model

The GNU Hurd implements a capability-based security model that provides fine-grained access control and improved security over traditional permission systems.

## Overview

Capabilities are unforgeable tokens that grant specific rights to access objects or perform operations. Unlike traditional ACL (Access Control List) systems, capabilities provide:

- **Unforgeable Access Rights**: Capabilities cannot be guessed or forged
- **Delegatable Permissions**: Rights can be safely passed between processes
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Processes only receive necessary capabilities
- **Revocable Access**: Capabilities can be revoked when no longer needed

## Core Concepts

### Capability Definition
A capability consists of:
- **Object Reference**: Identifies the resource or service
- **Access Rights**: Specifies allowed operations (read, write, execute, etc.)
- **Validity**: Whether the capability is currently valid

### Capability Operations
- **Grant**: Give a capability to another process
- **Invoke**: Use a capability to perform an operation
- **Restrict**: Create a new capability with fewer rights
- **Revoke**: Invalidate a capability

## Implementation in Hurd

### Mach Ports as Capabilities
- **Port Rights**: Mach ports serve as capability references
- **Send Rights**: Allow sending messages to a port
- **Receive Rights**: Allow receiving messages from a port
- **Port Sets**: Group related ports for efficient management

### Translator Capabilities
- **File System Access**: Translators use capabilities to access backing stores
- **Service Delegation**: Capabilities enable safe service composition
- **User-Space Security**: Security policies implemented in user space

### Authentication Server
- **Identity Management**: Central authentication using capabilities
- **Group Membership**: Capability-based group access control
- **Credential Delegation**: Safe sharing of authentication credentials

## Security Benefits

### Confinement
- **Sandbox Creation**: Processes can be confined using limited capability sets
- **Resource Isolation**: Prevent unauthorized access to system resources
- **Damage Limitation**: Breached processes have limited impact

### Distributed Security
- **Network Transparency**: Capabilities work across machine boundaries
- **Secure Communication**: Cryptographically protected capability transfer
- **Federated Systems**: Support for distributed trust relationships

### Audit and Accountability
- **Capability Tracking**: Monitor capability usage and delegation
- **Access Logging**: Record all capability-based operations
- **Security Analysis**: Analyze security policies and access patterns

## Practical Applications

### File System Security
```
# Example: Grant read-only access to a specific directory
translator_capability = create_translator_capability("/home/user/docs", READ_ONLY)
delegate_capability(process_id, translator_capability)
```

### Service Access Control
```
# Example: Restrict network access for a sandboxed application
network_capability = restrict_capability(full_network_access, [TCP_CONNECT])
grant_capability(sandboxed_app, network_capability)
```

### Inter-Process Communication
```
# Example: Secure message passing between processes
ipc_capability = create_ipc_capability(target_process, MESSAGE_SEND)
send_message(ipc_capability, message_data)
```

## Challenges and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Complexity**: Capability systems can be complex to understand and implement
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Integration with POSIX/UNIX security models
- **Performance**: Capability checks may introduce overhead
- **Revocation**: Implementing efficient capability revocation

### Ongoing Development
- **Capability Patterns**: Developing best practices for capability usage
- **Tool Support**: Creating tools for capability management and analysis
- **Documentation**: Improving capability system documentation
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing capability-related overhead

## Development in 9nu

### Implementation Status
- **Core Infrastructure**: Basic capability mechanisms implemented
- **Translator Support**: Capability-based translator framework
- **Authentication Integration**: Connection to authentication server
- **Development Tools**: Capability debugging and analysis tools

### Future Enhancements
- **Fine-Grained Capabilities**: More specific capability types
- **Delegation Policies**: Flexible capability delegation rules
- **Revocation Mechanisms**: Efficient capability revocation
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimized capability handling

## Programming Interface

### Capability Management Functions
```c
// Create a new capability
capability_t create_capability(object_id_t object, rights_t rights);

// Delegate a capability to another process
error_t delegate_capability(process_id_t target, capability_t cap);

// Restrict capability rights
capability_t restrict_capability(capability_t cap, rights_t new_rights);

// Revoke a capability
error_t revoke_capability(capability_t cap);
```

### Error Handling
- **CAPABILITY_INVALID**: Capability is not valid
- **PERMISSION_DENIED**: Insufficient rights for operation
- **CAPABILITY_REVOKED**: Capability has been revoked
- **DELEGATION_FAILED**: Unable to delegate capability

## Best Practices

### Capability Design
- **Minimal Rights**: Grant only necessary capabilities
- **Time Limits**: Use time-bounded capabilities when appropriate
- **Regular Audit**: Periodically review capability usage
- **Documentation**: Document capability requirements clearly

### Security Considerations
- **Capability Leakage**: Prevent unintended capability disclosure
- **Delegation Chains**: Manage complex delegation relationships
- **Revocation Planning**: Plan for capability revocation scenarios
- **Recovery Procedures**: Handle capability-related failures gracefully
