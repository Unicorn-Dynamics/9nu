As in the English dictionary, a delegate is "a person designated to represent or act for another"

Delegation is when one object (delegator) passes a helper object (delegate) to another object (delegatee?). A certain delegate to be delegated is passed between a delegator and a delegatee. Delegation is an alternative to inheritance.
