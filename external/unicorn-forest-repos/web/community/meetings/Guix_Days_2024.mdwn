From second day [sessions'
recap](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2024/guix-days-2024-recap):

    Hurd: Janneke Nieuwenhuizen led a discussion around GNU Hurd, which is
    a microkernel-based architecture.  Activity has increased in the last
    couple of years, and there's support for SMP and 64-bit (x86) is work
    in progress.  There's lots of ideas and excitement about getting Guix
    to work on Hurd.
