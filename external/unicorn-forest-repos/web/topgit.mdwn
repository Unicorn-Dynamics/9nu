We're using this for some packages, where we're maintaining long-lived
development branches, for example
[[source_repositories/glibc]].  The latter one has usage examples, too.

# Installing

It's fairly easy to install topgit.

You can simply installing from your distribution.

Alternatively, you can install it from source.

First, clone the git repo of topgit.

    $ git clone https://repo.or.cz/topgit.git
    $ cd topgit

Or download the tarball of source code directly and unpack it.

    $ curl -o topgit.tar.gz https://repo.or.cz/topgit.git/snapshot/f2815f4debdb07f86ee86dd4eb75280919ace55d.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf topgit.tar.gz
    $ cd topgit-f2815f4

Second, you have to build and install topgit with make. You can use
any prefix to specify the install place. But note that, if you
don't set `prefix`, it will default to `$HOME` rather than `$HOME/.local`,
which may NOT be what you want.

    $ make prefix=$HOME/.local install

The topgit executable file is `tg`. It will be installed into `$prefix/bin`.

Finally, add `$prefix/bin` to your `PATH` if you want to use `tg` directly in
your shell. Then test the installation by running `tg` and check the output.

# Running it on GNU/Hurd

Nothing special to that, technically, *only* that our [[I/O system's (non-)
performance|community/gsoc/project_ideas/disk_io_performance]] will render this
unbearably
slow for anything but simple test cases.  So don't try to run it on the [[GCC]]
or [[glibc]] repositories.  Talk to [[tschwinge]] about how he's using it on a
GNU/Linux machine and push the resulting trees to GNU/Hurd systems.
