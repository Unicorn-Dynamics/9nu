# Documentation

As Hurd support is integrated in Guix, the [official
documentation](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/) also works
for Hurd.

# Status

At the time of writing the Guix manual says "This configuration is
experimental and under development.  …  See
[Contributing](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Contributing.html),
on how to help!"

The easiest way to try Guix/Hurd is by setting up a Guix Childhurd
instance on your GNU/Linux machine.

Cross-building to x86_64-gnu [has just landed on Guix
master](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-patches/2024-12/msg00199.html).

# Childhurds

Guix' operating-system description supports a [`hurd-vm`
or *childhurd* service](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Virtualization-Services.html#The-Hurd-in-a-Virtual-Machine).
Specifying the `hurd-vm-service-type` in the `services` of an `operating system` description

        (operating-system
          ;; …
          (services
            (list
              ;; Add the 'hurd-vm' service
              (service hurd-vm-service-type)
               …
              %base-services)))

automagically builds and starts a `Childhurd` that can be also used
for
[offloading](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Daemon-Offload-Setup.html)
Hurd builds.

# Rumpdisk and NetDDE support

Guix supports NetDDE and Rumpdisk, also [running in a
Childhurd](https://toot.aquilenet.fr/@civodul/110848429561223704).

# Guix/Hurd on Real Iron

Guix/Hurd has been [ installed on a Thinkpad
X60](https://todon.nl/@janneke/110451493405777898).

The Guix installer supports cross-installation support for Guix/Hurd.

Of course Guix/Hurd can also be installed from a running GNU/Linux
system by doing something like:

        guix system init hurd.scm /hurd

An blog post was published about running [Guix/Hurd on a Thinkpad
X60](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2024/hurd-on-thinkpad/).
