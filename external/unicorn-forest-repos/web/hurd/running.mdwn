[[!meta title="Running the Hurd"]]

There are several different ways to run a GNU/Hurd system: 

* [[Distributions|Distrib]] - Distros based on the Hurd
* [[microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/Xen]] - In Xen
* [[Live_CD]] - As a live CD without installing (can also be run in QEMU)
* [[QEMU]] - In QEMU
* [[Cloud]] - In the "cloud": OpenStack
* [[Chroots|chroot]] need a couple of tricks to work properly.
* [[VirtualBox]] - In VirtualBox
* [Vagrant Basebox](https://github.com/bbesim/vagrant_GNU-debian-hurd_basebox) - On Vagrant
* [[vmware]] (**non-free!**)

<!-- This comment pushes the last li element "vmware" into the list. I don't know why, but it works. -->
