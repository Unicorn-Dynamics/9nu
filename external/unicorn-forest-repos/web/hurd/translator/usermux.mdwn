The word "mux" is reserved in the Hurd terminology to mean invoking
user specific translators based on the filename, which is what usermux
and [[hostmux]] do.  While, `hostmux` invokes a
translator based on the host name, `usermux` invokes a
translator based on the user name.  You should be able to use
`usermux` with [[nfs]].

	<ArneBab> does that mean you could very easily use nfs to
	          automatically mount the home folders of users by just
			  accessing them?
	<youpi> that's usermux, yes
	<giselher> I am confused where is the difference ?
	<youpi> usermux is specialized in user names
	<youpi> i.e. it can translate it into a uid before giving it as
	        parameter to the underlying translator, for instance
	<ArneBab> what I meant is a little different, I think:
	<ArneBab> each user has his/her own computer with the disk
	<ArneBab> and all can access each others  folders as if they were local
	<youpi> that could be done too
	<youpi> it's a bit like autofs on linux
	<giselher> settrans -ca nfs: /hurd/usermux /hurd/nfs server && cd nfs:/puplic
	<giselher> ^-- is that right?
	<ArneBab> youpi: but it can be done by anyone, not just root.
	<youpi> ArneBab: sure
	<youpi> giselher: I guess so
	<ArneBab> and that is a huge difference. It lowers a barrier,
	hopefully to such an extend that many more users can utilize it.
	<anatoly> but it'll distinguish different computers?
	<ArneBab> once the hurd has many more users, that is :)
	<anatoly> s/but/but how
	<youpi> anatoly: by a level of directories
	<anatoly> cd nfs:/foo.bar:/blabla - it's how it should be?
