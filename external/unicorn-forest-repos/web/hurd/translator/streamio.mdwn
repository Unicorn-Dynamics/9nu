`streamio` is a translator for kernel stream devices,
e.g. the kernel log messages or the parallel port.
It is mainly used for kernel devices, so you will need root
privileges to use it.  It provides a basic interface for character
devices.  It is low-level and cannot provide device-specific `ioctl`s.
It cannot provide buffering, data format conversions, etc.
