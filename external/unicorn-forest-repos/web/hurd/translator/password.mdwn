The password server (`/servers/password`) runs as root and hands out
authorization tags after receiving the correct password. The ids
corresponding to the authentication port match the unix user and group
ids.

Support for shadow passwords is implemented here. Several utilities
make use of this server, so they don't need to be setuid root.
