`devnode` is the Hurd devnode translator. It exposes a Mach device as
a filesystem node (hence "devnode"), so you can do `open("/dev/foobar")`
then `device_open("foobar")`. In particular this means that the
Unix permission model can be used to manage access to the fs node,
rather than you having to have the device master port (= be root).
