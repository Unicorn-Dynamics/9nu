The `eth-multiplexer` translator lets one share an ethernet device.
It is commonly used to set up subhurds' networking to share an
ethernet device with the subhurd and the main hurd.  The [[subhurds'
page|hurd/subhurd]] has a guide to show you how to do this.

Here's a basic example to get you started using the eth-multiplexer.
To do so, install the multiplexer at `/dev/eth0m`.

    # settrans -c /dev/eth0m /hurd/eth-multiplexer --interface=/dev/eth0

Then configure your main Hurd system to use the virtual network
interface `/dev/eth0m/0` instead of `/dev/eth0`.  On Debian/Hurd, this
can be accomplished via:

    # ifdown /dev/eth0
    # sed -i -e s_/dev/eth0_/dev/eth0m/0_ /etc/network/interfaces
    # ifup /dev/eth0m/0

Now you are all set to follow the [[subhurd's guide|hurd/subhurd]] to
set up a subhurd's networking!  If you want to do more cool stuff with
the `eth-multiplexer`, then you could take a look at the
[[hurd/translator/lwip]] page or [[hurd/translator/remap]] page.
