The hurd `symlink` translator lets you create a filesystem node that
refers to another node.  It is similar to the `ln` command.  Suppose
you begin writing a new filesystem for the hurd from scratch.  To
develop it quickly, you could skip implementing symlinks.  The user
would instead use the `/hurd/symlink` translator.  The Hurd could
provide all sorts of filesystem like functionality that would work
regardless of the user's choice of filesystem.

Please note that [[ext2fs]] does not use `/hurd/symlink`.  Instead it
supports linking directly in the filesystem, since that is faster than
using `/hurd/symlink`.
