rumpsound lets us use audio devices on the Hurd.  There is an
experimental/basic [[hurd rump audio
translator|https://github.com/dm0-/hurd-rump-audio]] that exists.  The
translator runs at `/dev/audio`, which is somehow similiar to a
Solaris audio device.  Any application that supports pulseaudio, can
play through this device.

Some Hurd developers, believe that pulseaudio may not be the best
choice for supporting sound on the Hurd.  Damien Zammit has several
[[ideas|https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2019-11/msg00086.html]]
how to get proper sound support on the Hurd.  The [[audio
page|open_issues/audio]] has more information.
