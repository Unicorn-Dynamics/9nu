# RumpNet

Hurd developers want to use rumpnet, so that we can use modern
ethernet and wifi device drivers.  The Hurd is currently using Linux's
old TCP/IP stack (`pfinet`) and device drivers.  We plan to replace
`pfinet` with [[lwip|hurd/translator/lwip]] and use rumpnet's modern
device drivers for ethernet and wifi hardware.  Alternatively, we
could use rump's TCP/IP stack.
