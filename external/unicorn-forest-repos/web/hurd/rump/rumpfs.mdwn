# What is rumpfs?

`Rumpfs` would let us use the [[NetBSD
filesystems|https://man.netbsd.org/fstab.5]], namely FFS, which is a
journaled filesystem that supports snapshots.  This is a significant
improvement over the Hurd's current filesystem:
[[ext2|hurd/translator/ext2fs]], which forces users to deal with
occassional filesystem corruption.  With FFS, this would no longer be
an issue, and NetBSD developers would maintain the FFS codebase.

As of October 2024, rumpfs still needs to be implemented.

Another option is to create an ext3fs.  We have a
[[task|https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5498]] for this, which mentions
some existing experimental code.

Another option is to create translators out of
[[libguestfs|hurd/translator/libguestfs]].
