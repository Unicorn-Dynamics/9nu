# RumpUSBDisk

With RumpUSBDisk, the Hurd can use a usb to SATA dongle to access a
SATA device.  StarTech offers a good quality dongle that works
well.  The Hurd could then read/write data from a SATA device with an
fatfs or ext2 filesystem.  Damien Zammit implemented [[rumpusbdisk
already|https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2023-07/msg00025.html]].
However, as of October 2024, netdde seems to exhibit a bug when
running `ifdown /dev/eth0` simultaneously to running the rumpusbdisk
translator, due to the two devices sharing the same IRQ.
