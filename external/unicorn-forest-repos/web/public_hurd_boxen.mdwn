[[!meta title="Public Hurd Boxen"]]

[[!tag stable_URL]]

The GNU/Hurd boxes are only available for people who have
already shown some level of involvement in the project. If you simply want to
try the Hurd, the easiest way is running it in a virtual machine.

An alternative to online shell access may be using a [[QEMU
image|hurd/running/qemu]].

with your DD account, your public ssh keys are already there. Debian maintainers
can also request an account.
