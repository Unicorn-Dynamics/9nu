<p class="statement-title"><strong>What is the GNU Hurd?</strong></p>
<p>The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.
It is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel
to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and
other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar
kernels (such as Linux).

<p class="statement-title"><strong>What is the mission of the GNU Hurd project?</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to create a general-purpose kernel suitable 
for the GNU operating system, which is viable for everyday use, 
and gives users and programs as much control over their 
computing environment as possible.

# Getting Help

There are a couple of different [[FAQ lists|FAQ]].
There are a number of [[IRC_channels|IRC]] and several
different [[mailing lists]] with searchable archives.

Before asking a question on a mailing list or on IRC, first, please try to
answer your own question using a search engine and reading the introductory
information.  If you have done this and you cannot find the answer to your
question, feel free to ask on a mailing list or on IRC.

<h1 id="run"> Running the Hurd </h1>

Running the Hurd may not be as hard as some people think. There are
[[various_ways|hurd/running]]. The easiest one might be using a
virtual machine platform. We also provide accounts on our [[public_Hurd_boxen]].

Four of them are

* Installing a [[GNU/Hurd_distribution|hurd/running/distrib]] to a real machine.
* Running it in [[Xen|microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/xen]].
* Running it with [[QEMU|hurd/running/qemu]].
* Running it with [[VirtualBox|hurd/running/virtualbox]], if you are familiar
  with VirtualBox or using an OS which is difficult to run QEMU like Windows.

For a virtual machine, you can use either a
[[pre-installed_qemu_image|hurd/running/qemu]]
or a [[LiveCD|hurd/running/live_cd/]]. The pre-installed image (converted
to proper format) can be used as a hard disk in a virtual machine to skip the
installation step and run the Hurd directly. The LiveCD is just like the one of
other OS.

There are also various [[GNU/Hurd_distributions|hurd/running/distrib]] which you
can choose from. The most functional one is the one provided
by Debian. It's a good choice for a start, whether you have experience with it,
or if you can't decide which one to choose. It provides both a pre-installed
image and a LiveCD. Find more information about it at the
[Debian GNU/Hurd website](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install).

And these web pages are a living proof of the usability of the Hurd, as they
are rendered on a [[Debian_GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] system.

# Current Status

<!-- I understand the "GNU" prefix is important, especially for Mach, since GNU Mach is an implementation of normal Mach. I'm assuming the reader picks up on this instinctively. Revert if it seems wrong. -->
The latest GNU releases are **Hurd 0.9**, **Mach 1.8**, and **MIG
1.8** [[(Release Notes)|news/2016-12-18-releases]], 2016-12-18.

The Hurd is developed by [[a few volunteers in their spare time|faq/how_many_developers]].
The project welcomes any assistance [[you can provide|contributing]].
Porting and development expertise is still badly needed in many key areas.

Functional systems are installable in a dual-boot configuration.  Development
systems are currently mostly based on the [[Debian_GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] port
sponsored by the [Debian project](http://www.debian.org/).

Aside from this Wiki, community resources for related projects focus around *[gnu.org](https://hurd.gnu.org)*, the *[[mailing lists]]*, and the *[[IRC_channels|IRC]]*.

If you want to see the current discussions in the Hurd project, please have a look at 
the [bug-hurd mailinglist archives](http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/). 
If you want to have a look at the current coding work, you can just head over to our
[[source_repositories]].

[[current_state_of_the_GNU_Hurd|hurd/status]]. 


## Advantages and Challenges

The GNU Hurd operating system design provides [[advantages]], but uncovers new
[[challenges]], too.
