[[!meta title="ABAC"]]

ABAC stands for authorization-based access control.
In this model, access is not granted based on the
identity of the caller but by an authorizing agent
that delegates access to a particular resource.
Such authorization is then encapsulated in
[[capabilities|capability]] allowing them to be freely [[delegated|delegation]].

Back in 2009, there [has been talk about](https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2009/HPL-2009-30.html) renaming "ABAC" to "ZBAC - [AuthoriZation Based Access Control](https://objectsecurity.com/blog/2016/08/05/authorization-based-access-control-zbac-model-driven-security/)" - This article says "ZBAC" instead of ABAC to avoid confusion, supposedly with "ABAC - Attribute-Based-Access-Control"
