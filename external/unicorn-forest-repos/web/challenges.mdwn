[[!meta title="Challenges"]]

The GNU Hurd has a lot of [[advantages]], but there are challenges, too.

Some of these are explained in the [[hurd/critique]].

Even though they're quite popular in the simpler embedded space, there is no
successful true multi-server [[microkernel]] system for general-purpose desktop
use yet.  This is still an ongoing research effort.  Also the Hurd is not the
only multiserver operating system. Other examples include:
[[Genode OS|https://genode.org/]] (FOSS),  [[MINIX 3|https://www.minix3.org/]] (FOSS), 
[[HELON OS|http://www.helenos.org/]] (FOSS), [[Redox OS|https://www.redox-os.org/]],
and [[QNX|https://blackberry.qnx.com/en]] (proprietary).

Likewise, [[resource scheduling|open_issues/multiprocessing]] in distributed operating system kernels is a
research topic. The GNU/Hurd also has
[[open_issues/resource_management_problems]]. The [[microkernel/Viengoos]]
research kernel project strives to fix these issues, but its development has ended.

TODO: more to come.  [[!tag open_issue_documentation]]
