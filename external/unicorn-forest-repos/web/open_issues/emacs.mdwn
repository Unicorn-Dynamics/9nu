GNU Emacs works pretty well.  It works beautifully in X.

Emacs version 29.1 runs on Debian GNU/Hurd. Joshua Branson uses it in
X without issue. He use org-mode, gnus, erc, calc, markdown-mode, etc.
In fact he, edits this wiki via Debian GNU/Hurd (running on a T43)
using Emacs.  He is able to make changes to the wiki, render the wiki,
look at the resulting webpage with the
[[netsurf|https://www.netsurf-browser.org/]] web browser, commit the
changes, and send a patch to `bug-hurd@gnu.org`, all while using the
Hurd.  :)

Also since the Hurd ported rust, you can now use
[[treesitter|https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter]]
with Emacs!  Joshua got
[[html-ts-mode|https://github.com/mickeynp/html-ts-mode]] working.

Emacs also has a packaged eglot, which is a client for language server
protocol, into core.  Joshua was able to get eglot working for C mode
with clandg, but it was a bit slow.  Joshua is running Emacs on a T43,
with 1.5 GB of RAM, so perhaps his hardware is just super slow.

You can easily install many Emacs packages with apt:

     # apt install elpa-zenburn-theme

Or you can use `use-package`.
