**For pure 64bit support, we need to**

  * bootstrap a distribution. Debian is done. Alpine-Hurd is mostly
    bootstrapped.  Reach out to Sergey if you are interested in an
    Alpine-Hurd distribution with bleeding-edge software.  Reach out
    to Guix, if you want to help them bootstrap a 64bit Hurd.

**TODO**

  * Fix swapping with rumpdisk
  * Fix crash-dump-core server

**Installing via the installer image**

The installer works fine in qemu.  Give it a shot!  Let us know
how it works in real hardware!

**Installing a 64bit system**

In principle crosshurd should be working.
