[[!meta title="Is there a 64-bit version?"]]

64-bit kernelland is supported with 32-bit userland, which notably
permits to efficiently make use of more than 2 GiB memory and provide 4 GiB
userland addressing space.

A 64-bit GNU/Hurd is also available, progress is tracked on [[open_issues/64-bit_port]]!
As of April 2025, the Debian hurd-amd64 port works just like the hurd-i386, except for
some bugs, namely swapping issues with rumpdisk and dumping core files.

We plan on supporting both a 
32-bit and 64-bit Debian GNU/Hurd, only not both at the same time.  
However, there is no plan to fix the year 2038 concern on a 32-bit system.

That being said, you can always run a 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine, it
just works, processes are just limited to a couple GiB available memory.
