[[!meta title="what hardware is supported? What drivers does GNU/Hurd have?"]]

As of September 2024, the Hurd runs well on old Thinkpads.  We
recommend the Thinkpad T60, which supports a maximum of 4GB of RAM,
and you can use an [[SSD|hurd/rump/rumpdisk]].  If you have difficulty
installing the Hurd, then try setting your harddrive mode to "legacy"
in the BIOS.  A cheaper option is the T43 (2GB max RAM).

Other working Thinkpads include the X200, T400, 
[[T410|https://logs.guix.gnu.org/hurd/2025-04-25.log#103752]] or T500 Thinkpads,
which support internet connectivity via the ethernet port.  You can
use an [[SSD|hurd/rump/rumpdisk]] on these laptops, which support a
maximum of 8GB of RAM.  The Debian installer images from 2023 fail to
boot these machines, but you can install the Hurd via [[Debian's
CrossInstall|hurd/running/debian/CrossInstall]] or 
[[mmdebstrap|https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2024/12/msg00003.html]].  

_While the [[64 bit port|faq/64-bit]] is about as stable as the 32-bit 
port, the rumpdisk support needed for it is still relatively experimental.
For this reason we recommend casual Hurd users to use the 32 bit port._

Other hardware that is known to work includes the [[Dell Inspiron
1750|https://logs.guix.gnu.org/hurd/2024-09-28.log]] on i386
Debian/Hurd.  It won't boot with the current installer (June 2023
debian-hurd i386 net-install) because of an FPU issue (fixed
upstream). I had to remove the optical drive. It hangs for one minute
during boot on ACPI init, but otherwise fine when disabling full tree
parsing.  The touchpad, keyboard, display, ethernet, and the hard
drive works (in legacy mode).

The Hurd can run on more recent Intel machines, but with [[no internet
connectivity|hurd/running/debian/DebianAptOffline]]!  You can always
use the Hurd via [[qemu|hurd/running/qemu]].

Currently, for disks Mach integrates old drivers from Linux through
some [[community/gsoc/project_ideas/driver_glue_code]], which provide
IDE disk support, and we have an AHCI driver which provides [[SATA
support|faq/sata_disk_drives]].  [[Rumpdisk|hurd/rump/rumpdisk]] lets
us use modern hard drives, like SSDs.

For network boards, we curently use the [[DDE]] toolkit to run linux
2.6.32 drivers in userland processes, which we may eventually replace
with [[rump drivers|hurd/rump]].  Note however that we have of course
not tested all drivers. We obviously don't even have all kinds of
hardware.  So we can not promise that they will all work. What
probably works for sure is what we usually use: the rtl8139 and e1000
drivers for instance. Firmware loading is not implemented yet.

For graphical mode, Xorg is supported, e.g. with the vesa driver. DRM
is not supported yet.  To run X then, you must use the proprietary
BIOS, since coreboot/libreboot do not include a working vesa driver.

Hurd developers are working on adding USB support with
[[rumpusbdisk|hurd/rump/rumpusbdisk]].

[[microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/Xen]] is also supported, both blkfront and
netfront.
