<!-- Hey it's me, MutoShack. Just wanted to say I'm removing all the
     [[!meta copyright...]] tags because Ikiwiki generates its own copyright section
     from /copyright. This will make the entire site more maintainable. If I'm wrong, hit me up. Cheers.-->

[[!meta title="Contact Us"]]

If you are having trouble running or programming the Hurd, or want to contact the community for another reason, here are some contact methods you can use. As usual, we recommend searching the mailing list archives and the Web first, just to make sure your question hasn't already been answered.

* [[Community]] -- the community around GNU Hurd.
* [[Trackers]] -- for reporting issues.
* [[Mailing_Lists]] -- preferred for general discussions, questions, bug
    reports, etc.
* [[IRC]] -- for interactive discussions with a smaller audience.
* Non-public mail contact to the maintainers.

If you have a concern you want to send to the Hurd maintainers without
    writing to a public mailing list, then please send email to
    <hurd-maintainers@gnu.org>.  Please don't send general support requests or
    questions there, but instead use the [[mailing lists]].
